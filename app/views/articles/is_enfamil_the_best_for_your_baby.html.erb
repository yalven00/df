<h2>Is Enfamil the Best Formula for Your Baby?</h2>
<p>Breast milk or formula? It's quite a heated topic in the parenting and medical communities. Some argue that breast milk is the only solution, while other doctors and researchers say that formula containing the proper nutrients can be as good as breast milk … in some cases even healthier.</p>
<p>No matter which option you choose, your goal is to provide your baby with proper nutrition needed for healthy development. And if you choose to go with infant formula, one of the best options is Enfamil. Here, we will examine whether it might be the right solution for your baby.</p>
<p>Enfamil is designed to offer the same, or in some cases, superior levels of nutrition when compared to breast milk. And if your baby is unable to handle lactose, or is diagnosed with certain food or milk sensitivities, then special formulations of the product may be your child's best options.</p> 
<p>No matter what your baby's unique needs, there's a formulation of Enfamil for that: one that mimics breast milk, one that promotes development in premature babies, and one that provides nutrients to infants who cannot absorb fat or ingest cow's milk … and much more.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that breastfeeding offers moms a chance to bond with their baby through physical contact and closeness. So can bottlefeeding offer the same benefit? Most moms say that holding your child to your chest while bottle feeding can provide the same level of closeness. Plus, dads can bottlefeed, too, and experience the same joy.</p>
<p>It's easy to see why many physicians say that this formula is the best choice for a number of babies.
