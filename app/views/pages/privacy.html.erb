<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2 class="mt28">Company Practices</h2>
<div class="mtb12">
The following statement describes the overall company practices of DealsForMommy (A Parent Media Group,Inc. company), along with its other affiliate and subsidiary companies (collectively "DealsForMommy"), including advertising on its own network of websites as well as products and services offered by DealsForMommy. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that DealsForMommy does not own or control, or to people that DealsForMommy does not employ.
</div>
<div class="mtb12">
DealsForMommy is very aware of the need to respect, and protect the privacy of its visitors. This privacy policy ("Policy") discloses the data collection methods and data usage practices of DealsForMommy (www.DealsForMommy.com). 
</div>
<div class="mtb12">
Because this Policy pertains to information collected only directly through or from the DealsForMommy network of sites, this Policy does not apply to personal information collected from offline resources and communications (for instance, if you send us a postal letter or give us a phone call). This Policy also does not apply to third party online resources to which the DealsForMommy network of websites may link, where DealsForMommy does not control the content, nor the privacy practices. 
</div>
<div class="mtb12">
Please read this Policy carefully. Should any questions arise about this Policy or our data collection, use or disclosure practices, please contact us in any of the ways listed at the end of this Policy. Please also be sure to read our complete Terms of Use, of which this Privacy Policy is a part.

<h2 class="mt28">What is Non-Personally Identifiable Data?</h2>
</div>
<div class="mtb12">
With respect to individuals who visit the DealsForMommy network of sites, we, and/or one or more of our third party advertising technology vendors, may collect what is known as "Click Stream Data." Click Stream Data is anonymous, and includes information such as a visitor's IP address, web pages which have been viewed by a visitor, date and time, domain type, and responses by a visitor to an advertisement and content delivered by us or a third party advertising technology vendor. We, and/or a third party advertising technology vendor, may use different types of technologies to collect this type of information, including cookies and web beacons (1x1 pixels). As a part of the registration process at DealsForMommy properties, we may request and collect additional non-personally identifiable information about the visitor. Examples of the non-personally identifiable data that may be requested include age, gender, and geographic location. None of the aforementioned information (collectively referred to as "non-personally identifiable data"), by itself, or together, can by its nature be tracked to a specific individual.
</div>
<div class="mtb12">
<h2 class="mt28">What is Personally Identifiable Information?</h2>
</div>
<div class="mtb12">
The term "personally identifiable information" as used in this Policy means any information or set of information that identifies a specific individual. DealsForMommy is committed to making sure that clear notice and choice is provided to all consumers before the personally identifiable data is collected, and that they have opted-in to our use of their data. Examples of personally identifiable data that may be requested include name, address and email address. Additionally, visitors may volunteer sensitive health information such as conditions, medication(s) used and other sensitive information about themselves and/or family members. Visitors who have provided personally identifiable information and sensitive health information may elect to have their data deactivated from our files, or kept from being used for purposes other than for the service requested, by following the instructions described in the "Contact Us" section of this Policy. Should you elect to have your data deactivated from our files, please note that you will also compromise your future ability to log into DealsForMommy sites. 
</div>
<div class="mtb12">
<h2 class="mt28">How is Information Used?</h2>
</div>
<div class="mtb12">
When you volunteer information on DealsForMommy sites, personal information including name, email, birth date and gender is used to create your account profile. Once registered, you have the option to create a profile with more detailed information.

<div class="mtb12">
When you select to email, or tell a friend about DealsForMommy sites, we request their email address to send them a one- time email inviting them to DealsForMommy sites. This information is not used for any purposes beyond that for which it has been provided. 
</div>
<div class="mtb12">
In addition, declared visitor information may also be appended with additional information from external sources -- this is done to enrich your personalized experience while visiting our sites (for example, providing better newsletter content, advertising or special offers that may interest you). DealsForMommy may also compare its own visitor list to lists received from third party companies, in an effort to provide better service.

DealsForMommy is not responsible for, and will not be liable for, their conduct, actions, omissions, or information handling or dissemination practices.

</div>
<div class="mtb12">
DealsForMommy may place "cookies" on a visitor's computer. Cookies are small text files that save anonymized data about individual visitors, allowing DealsForMommy to recognize a visitor (thereby foregoing the mandatory step of having to re-enter your password each time you visit DealsForMommy sites), and help DealsForMommy deliver personalized content and other services. Many Web browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You may change your browser settings to either reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is about to be placed on your computer. Please note, however, that rejecting cookies while visiting DealsForMommy sites may result in certain parts of the sites not operating correctly or as efficiently as if they were allowed access to cookies. For example, if you are a DealsForMommy member, you may need to enter your username and password each time you visit the Web Site. 
</div>
<div class="mtb12">
Third-party advertising companies that DealsForMommy may partner with, as referenced above, may also employ cookies and web beacons (also known as 1x1 GIFs) to measure advertising effectiveness, delivery & targeting of messages. Please note that these companies are independent third parties over which DealsForMommy exercises no control. DealsForMommy is not responsible for, and will not be liable for, their conduct, actions, omissions, or information handling or dissemination practices.
